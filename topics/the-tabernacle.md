The function and importance of the _Tent of Meeting_ is explicitly stated in
Exodus 33:7-11. In simple terms, it was a place where the Israelites would meet
with the LORD. Moses had the tent pitched outside the camp some distance away
from the camp and anyone inquiring of the LORD would go to the tent — v7.

* Whenever Moses went out to the tent all the people would rise and stand at the
  entrances to their tents — v8.
* As Moses would enter the tent of meeting a pillar of cloud would come down and
  stay at the entrance (as the LORD spoke to him) — v9. The LORD would speak
  with Moses face to face, as a man speaks with his friend — v11.
* As the cloud was at the entrance the people would all stand up and worship,
  each at the entrance of their tent — v10.
