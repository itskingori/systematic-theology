## The Book of {{ page.title }}

Hosea is the **28th book of the Bible** which contains a number of God's prophecies and messages for both Judah and Israel. These are delivered by the prophet Hosea. A brief outline of the concepts presented in the Book of Hosea exist below.

* **Chapters 1–3:** Account of Hosea's marriage with Gomer which is a metaphor for the relationship with God and Israel.

* **Chapter 4-10:** A series of oracles, or prophetic sermons, showing exactly why God is rejecting the Northern Kingdom (what the grounds are for the divorce).

* **Chapter 11:** God's lament over the necessity of giving up the Northern Kingdom, which is a large part of the people of Israel, whom God loves. God promises not to give them up entirely.

* **Chapter 12:** The prophet pleads for Israel's repentance.

* **Chapter 13:** Foretells the destruction of the kingdom at the hands of Assyria, because there has been no repentance.

* **Chapter 14:** The prophet urges Israel to seek forgiveness, and promises its restoration, while urging the utmost fidelity to God.

The capital of the Northern Kingdom fell in 722 BC. All the members of the upper classes and many of the ordinary people were taken captive and carried off to live as prisoners of war.
