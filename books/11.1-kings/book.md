## The Book of {{ page.title }}

First Kings is the **11th book of the Bible** and it continues the story where 2
Samuel left off. Chapters 1-2 complete the presentation of the reign of David
and the succession of Solomon. Chapters 3-11 depict Solomon's glorious reign,
highlighted by the construction of the temple, but including his ultimate
apostasy. Chapters 12-14 relate Jeroboam's rebellion, his censure by the
prophets, and the resulting division of the nation into the northern kingdom of
Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. The rest of 1 Kings details the reigns
of the divided monarchy, alternating between the north and the south, but with
the bulk of the material considering the period of Israelite supremacy,
especially under Omri and Ahab. In this period the prophet Elijah is a dominant
force. [[1][link-1]]
