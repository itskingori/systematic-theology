King Rehoboam was the last king of the 12 united tribes which he ruled for a brief period until a revolt broke the peace (1 Kings 12). This made him the first king of the southern kingdom comprised of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.

He was the son of [King Solomon][king-solomon-son-of-king-david] and therefore a descendant of [King David][king-david-son-of-jesse]. His mother was an Ammonite (non-Jew) called Naamah. See 1 Kings 14:21.

He did evil in the eyes of the LORD. See 1 Kings 14:22-24, 2 Chronicles 12:14.

He lived in Jerusalem (2 Chronicles 11:5).


### Reign

He became king at the age of 41 years and ruled for a total of 17 years in Jerusalem (1 Kings 14:21, 2 Chronicles 12:13) and his son, Abijah, succeeded him as king (1 Kings 14:31). His coronation was in Shechem (1 Kings 12:1, 2 Chronicles 10:1).

During his reign there was continual warfare between [King Jeroboam][king-jeroboam-son-of-nebat] and him (1 Kings 14:30).


### Family

All in all, he had 18 wives, 60 concubines, 28 sons and sixty daughters (2 Chronicles 11:21). Only a few are mentioned:
