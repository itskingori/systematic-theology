King Jeroboam's story starts as a rebel against King Solomon. He was one of King Solomon's officials and an Ephraimite from Zeredah. His mother was a widow named Zeruah. See 1 Kings 11:26.

Prior to his reign, Jeroboam was a man of standing and King Solomon put him in charge of the whole labour force after he saw how well he worked (1 Kings 11:28). And so one day, while out in the country, he received word from the LORD through Ahijah the prophet of Shilloh that he would reign over 10 tribes of because King Solomon hadn't kept the LORD's laws and statutes (1 Kings 11:40).

He fled to Egypt (to King Shishak) for fear of his life after King Solomon tried to kill him. King Shishak is the same king who would later raid the temple and the royal palace during [King Rehoboam's][king-rehoboam-son-of-king-solomon] reign (1 Kings 14:25,26 and 2 Chronicles 12:9).

After King Solomon's death, Rehoboam (his son), succeeded him as king. King Jeroboam then becomes a central figure in the rebellion that eventually led to the split of the kingdom into the north and the south (1 Kings 12:1-17 and 2 Chronicles 10:1-17). Jeroboam was then made king of Israel by the people after the rebellion against King Rehoboam (1 Kings 12:20).

### Reign

King Jeroboam reigned for 22 years. His son Nadab succeeded him as king (1 Kings 14:19,20). He did evil in the eyes of the LORD.

He set up two golden calves so that his people would not go to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices. He thought that if they did, they would again give allegiance to King Rehoboam, who ruled from Judah. This became a sin as people went as far as Dan wto worship one set up there. (1 Kings 12:28-30)

He built shrines on high places and appointed priests from all sorts of peole even if they were not Levites. He even instituted a festival to offer sacrifices on the altar at Bethel. (1 Kings 12:31-33)

Even after being reprimanded by a man of God (1 Kings 13:1-10), King Jeroboam did not change his evil ways, but once more appointed priests for the high places from all sorts of people. Anyone who wanted to become a priest he consecrated for the high places and this eventually led to the downfall and total destruction of the house of King Jeroboam (1 Kings 13:33,34).
