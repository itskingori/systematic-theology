King Jeroboam's story starts as a rebel against King Solomon. He was one of King Solomon's officials and an Ephraimite from Zeredah. His mother was a widow named Zeruah. See 1 Kings 11:26.

Prior to his reign, Jeroboam was a man of standing and King Solomon put him in charge of the whole labour force after he saw how well he worked (1 Kings 11:28). And so one day, while out in the country, he received word from the LORD through Ahijah the prophet of Shilloh that he would reign over 10 tribes of because King Solomon hadn't kept the LORD's laws and statutes (1 Kings 11:40).

He fled to Egypt (to King Shishak) for fear of his life after King Solomon tried to kill him. King Shishak is the same king who raided the temple and the royal palace during [King Rehoboam's][king-rehoboam-son-of-king-solomon] reign (1 Kings 14:25,26 and 2 Chronicles 12:9).

After King Solomon's death, Rehoboam (his son), succeeded him as king. King Jeroboam then becomes a central figure in the rebellion that eventually led to the split of the kingdom into the north and the south (1 Kings 12:1-17 and 2 Chronicles 10:1-17).
