King Saul was the first king of the united kingdom of Israel. Previously the
LORD was the one who lead the Israelites (1 Samuel 8:6-9). He gave them judges
until the time of Samuel the prophet; then the people asked for a king and he
gave them Saul who ruled for 40 years (Acts 13:20).

There was bitter war with the Philistines all the days of his life and whenever
he saw a mighty or brave man, he took him into his service (1 Samuel 14:52).

He died because he was unfaithful to the LORD as he did not keep the word of the
LORD and even consulted a medium for guidance. So the LORD put him to death and
turned the kingdom over to the David (1 Chronicles 10:13-14, Acts 13:21).

He was a Benjamite and son of Kish (1 Samuel 9:1).
